Concurrent word count demos
===

These are quick language demos for concurrent word counts in Erlang and Go, for the CHUUG meeting of October 2013.  The intent is to download a list of URL's (text file, 1 per line), then fetch & process those URL's in parallel (i.e. concurrently) to strip HTML and yield a composite word frequency count.

Note, at the moment both versions have a hard-coded seed URL of http://tedb.us/urls.txt .  This is an early version and some work on the HTML-stripping regexes might be required.  It seems to basically work for demo purposes but there are probably bugs.

Erlang
---

For Erlang, concurrency is achieved by handling each URL in a process and results are communicated by Erlang messages.

To run:
	
	cd Erlang
	escript wordcount.erl

or, to run compiled:

	cd Erlang
	erlc wordcount.erl
	erl -noshell -s wordcount -s init stop

Go
---

Similarly, for Go, each URL is handled in a goroutine, and reuslts are communicated using a Go channel.

To run:
	
	cd Go
	go run wordcount.go

or, to run compiled:

	cd Go
	go build wordcount.go
	./wordcount
